  This implementation has a fixed gap cost (i.e. extending a gap is considered
  free). In the terminology of the Wikipedia description, W_k = {c, c, c, ...}.
  This implementation also has a fixed alignment score, awarded if the relevant
  characters are equal.

  Kinda slow, especially for large (50+ char) inputs.
